// 1. "Ayo"
let user: [number, string] = [1, "Ayo"];
/* Tuples are useful key value
pairs such as number or string*/

/*The code can be confusing
if you have more than two value pairs in it
example below */
let users: [number, string, boolean, number] = [1, "Ayo", true, 0];
//the code above is confusing.

//TUPLES IS USEFUL WHEN COMPARING OR USING TWO KEY VALUE PAIRS.
